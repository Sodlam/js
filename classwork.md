1. Data Types

	•	Q1: Declare variables of each JavaScript primitive data type and log their types to the console.
	•	Q2: Write code to check if a variable is a string or number.
	•	Q3: Create a function that takes a parameter and returns "This is a string" if the parameter is a string, otherwise returns "Not a string".
	•	Q4: Given a variable, identify if it’s null or undefined without using typeof.
	•	Q5: Create an object with a bigint property and add 5 to it. (Hint: Research BigInt arithmetic.)

2. Arrow Functions

	•	Q1: Write an arrow function to return the square of a number.
	•	Q2: Create an arrow function that checks if a number is even or odd and returns “Even” or “Odd.”
	•	Q3: Write an arrow function to filter an array of numbers, keeping only even numbers.
	•	Q4: Modify the previous function to accept any filtering function and apply it to an array of numbers.
	•	Q5: Convert this traditional function to an arrow function and simplify it as much as possible:

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}



3. Objects

	•	Q1: Create an object with properties name, age, and isStudent, and log it to the console.
	•	Q2: Add a method to your object that logs a greeting message using its name property.
	•	Q3: Write a function that takes an object and returns all of its keys as an array.
	•	Q4: Modify the function to return an array of key-value pairs for each property.
	•	Q5: Given an object, write a function to clone it without using JSON methods or external libraries.

4. Arrays

	•	Q1: Create an array of three favorite fruits and log the second fruit.
	•	Q2: Write a function that takes an array and returns the last element.
	•	Q3: Modify the previous function to remove and return the last element from the array.
	•	Q4: Write a function that accepts two arrays and returns an array containing only unique elements.
	•	Q5: Use array methods to sort an array of objects by a specific property (e.g., age) in descending order.

5. TypeOf

	•	Q1: Declare a variable of each data type and log typeof for each.
	•	Q2: Write a function that takes any variable and logs whether it’s a function, object, or primitive data type.
	•	Q3: Write a function that returns the type of each element in an array (e.g., [1, "hello", true] should return ["number", "string", "boolean"]).
	•	Q4: Modify the previous function to return a count of each type in an array.
	•	Q5: Create a function that uses typeof to validate an object’s property types against an expected type list.

6. Type Conversion

	•	Q1: Convert the number 42 to a string and log the result.
	•	Q2: Write a function that takes a boolean value and returns "true" or "false" as strings.
	•	Q3: Create a function that converts a stringified number into an integer and checks if it’s greater than 10.
	•	Q4: Write a function that converts a mixed array of strings and numbers to all numbers.
	•	Q5: Implement a function that takes any value and converts it into a boolean. (Hint: Think about Falsy and Truthy values in JavaScript.)

7. Errors (Try, Catch, Finally & Throw Statements)

	•	Q1: Write a try-catch block that handles a division by zero error.
	•	Q2: Write code that intentionally throws an error if an input is not a number.
	•	Q3: Create a function that uses try, catch, and finally to parse a JSON string. If it fails, log an error message.
	•	Q4: Write a function that accepts a number and throws a custom error if the number is negative, then catches the error and logs a message.
	•	Q5: Create a function that runs multiple error-prone tasks, catching errors as they occur, and logs each error’s type and message.

8. Strict Mode

	•	Q1: Enable strict mode and try assigning to an undeclared variable.
	•	Q2: Create a function that runs with strict mode and attempts to assign a value to a const variable.
	•	Q3: Write code in strict mode that tries to delete a variable and observe the error.
	•	Q4: Define a function in strict mode that receives two parameters, and try to assign values directly to the arguments object.
	•	Q5: Write a function that works in strict mode and uses this. Explain what happens when the function is called normally and as a method.

9. Reserved Words

	•	Q1: List five reserved words in JavaScript.
	•	Q2: Try using let or const as variable names and observe the error message.
	•	Q3: Explain why certain words like for and while are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers.
	•	Q4: Write a function that checks if a string is a reserved word in JavaScript and returns true or false.
	•	Q5: Create a script that uses an object to store reserved words as keys and test if a word is reserved by accessing its key in the object.
